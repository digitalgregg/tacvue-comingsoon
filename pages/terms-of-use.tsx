            Appendix 1 - Additional Rights for Individuals Located in the EU
          </h2>
          <p>
            Under the GDPR individuals located in the EU have extra rights which
            apply to their personal information. Personal information under the
            GDPR is often referred to as personal data and is defined as
            information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person{" "}
            {"(individual)"}. This Appendix sets out the additional rights we
            give to individuals located in the EU, including how we process
            personal information lawfully, transparently and fairly. Please read
            the Privacy Policy above and this Appendix carefully and contact us
            at the details at the end of the Privacy Policy if you have any
            questions.
          </p>
          <h2 className={h2Styles}>What personal information is relevant?</h2>
          <p>
            This Appendix applies to the personal information set out in the
            Privacy Policy above. This includes any sensitive information also
            listed in the Privacy Policy above which is known as ‘special
            categories of data’ under the GDPR.
          </p>

          <h2 className={h2Styles}>Our commitment to you</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Your personal information will:</p>
            <ul className={ulStyles}>
              <li>

              <li>

                and personal information will not be further processed in a
                manner that is incompatible with the purposes we have

                of your personal information);
              </li>
              <li>
                be kept in a form which permits us to identify you, but only for
                so long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal
                information was collected; and

          <h2 className={h2Styles}>How we process personal information</h2>
          <p>
            We will process your personal information for our legitimate
            interest to allow you to access and use our website, to send you
            marketing content we think may be of interest to you, to contact you
            if you leave your contact details with us or if you otherwise
            initiate contact with us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will rely on performing a contract to process your personal
            information where we are preparing to enter into a contract with you
            or we are carrying out our obligations under a contract with you,
            such as to set up an account for you and delivering our game to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will rely on a legal obligation to process your personal
            information where we are subject to a legal obligation. If we need
            to rely on consent, we will ask for consent to process any of your
            personal information for that specific purpose before we process
            your personal information for that reason. If you are under 16 years
            of age, we will seek your parent or legal guardian’s consent to
            process your personal information for that specific purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon written request, we may provide you with a list of the third
            parties we use to process your personal information.
          </p>
          <h2 className={h2Styles}>Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We will only retain your personal information for as long as
            necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for
            the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
            information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
            personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised
            use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for
            which we process your personal information, whether we can achieve
            those purposes through other means and the applicable legal
            requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your
            data: see ‘access, erasure and data portability’ below for further
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information (so
            that it can no longer be associated with you) for analytics,
            research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this
            anonymised information indefinitely without further notice to you.
          </p>
          <h2 className={h2Styles}>Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            The countries to which we send data for the purposes listed above
            may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which
            you initially provided the information. If we transfer your personal
            information to third parties in other countries: (i) we will perform
            those transfers in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR; and
            (ii) we will protect the transferred personal information in
            accordance with the Privacy Policy, as supplemented by this
            Appendix.

            of your personal information that is based on our legitimate
            interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide

            considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of
            legitimate interests.
